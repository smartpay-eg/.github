Certainly! To achieve this on Linux, you can use a combination of Git hooks and a service manager like systemd. Here are the steps to create a service that pulls changes from GitHub whenever there are new commits to a specific branch:

1. **Create a Git hook:**

   Open your Git repository and navigate to the `.git/hooks` directory. Create a new file named `post-receive`. This hook will be executed after changes are pushed to the repository.

   ```bash
   touch /path/to/your/repo/.git/hooks/post-receive
   ```

   Make the file executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/your/repo/.git/hooks/post-receive
   ```

   Edit the `post-receive` file with your preferred text editor:

   ```bash
   nano /path/to/your/repo/.git/hooks/post-receive
   ```

   Add the following content to the `post-receive` hook script:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   while read oldrev newrev refname
   do
       branch=$(git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref $refname)

       if [ "$branch" = "your_specific_branch" ]; then
           echo "Changes pushed to $branch. Pulling changes..."
           git --git-dir=/path/to/your/repo/.git --work-tree=/path/to/your/repo pull origin $branch
       fi
   done
   ```

   Save and exit the text editor.

2. **Create a systemd service:**

   Create a new systemd service file for your Git pull service. For example, create a file named `git-pull.service`:

   ```bash
   nano /etc/systemd/system/git-pull.service
   ```

   Add the following content to the `git-pull.service` file:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Git Pull Service

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'cd /path/to/your/repo && git pull origin your_specific_branch'

   [Install]
   WantedBy=default.target
   ```

   Save and exit the text editor.

3. **Enable and start the systemd service:**

   Reload systemd to detect the new service:

   ```bash
   systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

   Enable the service to start on boot:

   ```bash
   systemctl enable git-pull.service
   ```

   Start the service:

   ```bash
   systemctl start git-pull.service
   ```

   Check the status to ensure there are no errors:

   ```bash
   systemctl status git-pull.service
   ```

Now, whenever changes are pushed to the specified branch, the `post-receive` Git hook will trigger the `git-pull.service` systemd service to pull the changes from GitHub. Adjust the paths and branch name in the scripts according to your specific setup.
